<h1>Safe Walk</h1>

<h3>About</h3>

Safe Walk is an app designed to help predict the safest walking route.

The app will pull in data from the Google maps, directions and places APIs to find the quickest way along a route with businesses that are open. 

It will also incorporate a heatmap from Trulia's API with crime data from Spot Crime and Crime Reports.

<h3>Phase 1</h3>

The first phase will be to create a draggable route to let users alter their route to the safest route as shown with open businesses, nearby police stations and statistically low crime activity.

<h3>Phase 2</h3>

The second phase will automatically recommend the safest route to take.  

It will also include the addition of a new feature that allows the user to text or email their location to a friend or family member to show when they leave, where they're going and ability to check in when they've arrived to show that they've gotten to their final destination safely.

<h3>Phase 3 - Optional</h3>

The last (optional) phase will move the app from a strictly web-based app to a mobile app.  I will determine later if this will be feasible in the time I have left at gSchool once I have gotten through the first two phases.

<h3>Note</h3>
I am currently working on the google-map branch, not the master branch while I move from Mapbox to Google Maps.
