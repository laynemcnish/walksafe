<h3>About</h3>

Web application that helps pedestrians find the safest walking routes using governmental crime data, business hours and proximity to safe locations including hospitals and police stations.

Implemented with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Google Maps JavaScript API v3 and CartoDB.

Features currently under development include real time GPS tracking, a customizable user interface, a dead manâ€™s switch, shareable routes, and a native mobile application.

Currently, the only supported city is Denver, CO but I will add other metropolitan areas as soon as possible!

If you want to see the roadmap for where this application is going, please check out the [Trello Board]("https://trello.com/b/gpcuE8Ri/walksafely").
